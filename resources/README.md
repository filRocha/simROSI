	- added logos and org. members.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2019-10-15 - Added simulation time flag

- Kinect and the UR-5 tool cam were publishing the ROS time on its header. We added a 
	param `time_header_getSimTime` so, if it is enabled, those sensor publish in Simulation time.

## 2019-09-27 - Rosi URDF for Moveit

 - There was a problem involving MoveIt and the former Rosi URDF. Something about the decimal signal (point or comma). Created `<rosi_defy>/urdf/rosi_moveIt.urdf` for MoveIt and Gazebo integration.

	- Added a vision sensor to the UR5 tool.
	- Fixed kinect depth image step to width x 2.
	- Changed kinect frame id to camera_rgb_optical_frame (rgb) and camera_depth_optical_frame (depth).
	- Rosi publishes its first static transform to ROS tf server.
	- Velodyne treatment now is on an external plugin. See README.md for more information.
	- Velodyne now publishes in PointCloud2 format.
	- Fixed dynamical arms bounding box.
	- Fixed kinetic static object mounted over dynamic.
	- Removed dynamic arms local and global response.
	
- Added flag to deactivate fire rendering in './config/parameters.yaml'.

- in './resources/regulamento_rosiChallenge' - Regulation (V1.3):
	- Added the description for the vision sensor from UR5 tool.
	- Added Wenderson G. Serrantola as support commissioner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2019-08-27 - URDF ADDITION and

	- Changed 'arm_dynX' -> 'Scene Object Properties -> Select base of model instead' box trully checked.
	- Model rotated in 3.14 rad around its z axis.

- in './README.md'
